# Emergence-of-mixed-mode
Codes used in our paper Emergence of mixed mode oscillations in random networks of diverse excitable neurons:the role of neighbors and electrical coupling are stored here.Two network adjacency matrices are given one is erdos renyi graph of node N=500 with average node-degree <k>=5 and second one is watts strogatz network of N=500,p=0.2 and <k>=8.First code neuron_fraction is used to generate fig (2.e) and (6.f) by changing coupling strenth and network adjacency.Second code neuron_mmo_network is used to generate fig. 1.(a-l),fig 2.(b-d) and fig. 6.(b-e).Third code neuron_network_isi is used to generate fig (4.a) and (4.b).
